# libgdx-android-full
A sample libgdx project that comes initialized with all of the trimmings. 

The main `Activity` showcases the impressive 3D physics example provided by [xoppa](https://github.com/xoppa), and provides a simple enhancement to the demo Factory Pattern to provide support for physics simulation using 3D Models. The core project structure was generated using the [libgdx Project Setup Tool](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-Setup-Gradle), and imported `.g3db` assets were generated from `.fbx` files from Blender using the [fbx-conv](https://github.com/libgdx/fbx-conv) tool.
